Victim sent $2,000 to purchase Bitcoin and transferred it to Cherry who told her she had set up an account with her trading company, 247tradegrowth.net. At some point, the victim’s account balance showed she had made a profit of $21,800. But when she attempted to cash out, the victim was told that she had to pay a withdrawal fee of $3,650. She then contacted Cherry, who convinced her to invest another $1,000 worth of bitcoin because he had done so well. After a week, her account showed a profit of $45,800. This time, when Cherry told her she needed to pay a withdrawal fee, the victim sent $3,700. She had to borrow the money and followed a list of instructions Cherry sent but was told her withdrawal was pending. She contacted Cherry again, who told the victim to give the “Support Team” access to her Instagram account including back up codes. The victim soon received a message from the Support Team saying she needed to pay more fees, up to $12,400 in order to upgrade her account to comply with SEC regulations as her account balance was so high. She called Cherry and pleaded with her that she needed her money back, but Cherry didn’t reply. At this point, the victim realized this was a scam and reset her Instagram account again.

Later, she learned that her Driver’s License and Social Security Number had been placed on the dark web. She also learned that the friend who had contacted her about Cherry also had had their account hacked, and so it wasn’t even really her friend who first contacted her.",Liquidity Mining Scam,Cherry Thaddeus,https://247tradegrowth.net/faq.php

The victim purchased Tether USDT crypto currency from Crypto.com, then connected his offline wallet to the exchange and began trading USDT/Bitcoin futures contracts. The victim believed he was trading very successfully, so he transferred more money into the platform and believed his acquaintance was also crediting money into his account as well. The victim made a small withdrawal early in the process to ""test"" the process and his withdrawal went through. But after more ""successful"" trades, the victim attempted to make a larger withdrawal. At that point, the exchange informed him it did not allow such a large withdrawal, citing “anti-money laundering” protocol established by the “International Banking Regulatory Bureau,” which required him to trade at least 50% of their deposits in their trading account within 24 hours of attempting a withdrawal. So, the victim deposited more funds into his account, and was told his acquaintance had transferred money into his account as well, so he could withdraw the amount he wanted. The exchange called this process a “recharge.” Again, the victim believed had made more successful trades and now had enough money to make his planned withdraw as he met the minimum trade threshold. This time, the exchange denied the withdrawal request, again citing the “International Banking Regulatory Bureau” concern that his account was being used for money laundering, effectively freezing my account to withdrawals. The victim asked how he could prove he was not a money launderer and was told by the exchange he would need to deposit into his wallet the exact amount he had been trying to withdraw, which was $650,000. The victim contacted his trading partner/acquaintance, and she stated her account had also been frozen and that he would need to comply with the exchanges’ instructions. He asked customer service what to do and was told if he transferred the $650,000 and provided a screen shot of the balance, they would release the funds. The victim took out a loan and deposited about half of the $650,000 in two installments into what he believed was a safe account for such purposes. But as soon as the second deposit went in, without his consent or knowledge the exchange moved the money into his trading account. He protested but was told this was to secure his funds while he finished the verification process. And that the only way to access his money would be to deposit the remaining funds to get to $650,000, although they said they would allow him to trade in the account – just not make withdrawals. His money is now trapped, and he is concerned that there might be problems with the exchange. He is also suspicious about his acquaintance, who told him she followed the exchange’s instructions, borrowed money, and was finally able to withdraw her money and thus encouraged him to borrow more money as well.
