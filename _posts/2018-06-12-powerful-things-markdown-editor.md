In the last couple of years it appears that crypto‚Äôs been through its life cycle. We‚Äôve been intrigued by the technology, some were fascinated by the potential for profits and altruism, few were (rightfully) skeptical, and thousands lost millions of dollars, tainting whatever credability aultristic crypto capitilism ever had. In crypto realms, consumer crypto attacks are just a fraction but to the average online user, they might be the most impactful. And unfortunately, these scams show no sign of slowing down. With the ease of use of more sophisticated large language models, more realistic messages, images, texts, voice calls could potentially lure more customers. 

The State of California recently came out with a crypto scam tracker, which could function as a safeguard for wary customers. This analysis breaks down the narratives to provide supplemental information to help consumers better understand the commonalities of common scams.

Fraudulent trading platform (FTP) and pig butchering scams are by far the most prevalent type of crypto scams. FTP scams usually invovle slightly different domain names from legitimate crypto platforms. Initially users are allowed to withdraw small amounts, but later as the users attempt to withdraw larger earnings the sites either shut down or decline the request. These platforms can also capture users' sensitive financial data. Pig butchering scams are initiated on social media and dating apps. Pig butchering scams caused the highest losses, totally $2.7 billion [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-fraud-thailand/). About 12% of Americans using such apps reported victimization as of October 2023. 

The reported complaint narratives can help us understand the roadmap of the scam and provide insights for consumers that could help them protect themselves. One particulariy vulnerable population are the elderly, as illustrated by the following example. 

> A California resident reports that his elderly father has been scammed by a stranger on the internet. He says his father received a phone call from a stranger who then gained his trust by sending text messages, and encouraging him to begin communicating through the Line app. Eventually, the stranger convinced the victim she could give him investment advice, and helped the victim move money in and out of bank accounts, retirement accounts and crypto exchanges. The victim eventually lost at least $2.7 million.


The following roadmap illustrates the general cycle of the pig butchering scams.
