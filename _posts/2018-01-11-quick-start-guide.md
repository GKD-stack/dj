### Introduction

Addressing the concerning rise in maternal mortality rates in the United States, particularly among women of color, my project explores the potential of doula services to mitigate this issue. Traditionally a resource for the affluent, this research focuses on making doula services accessible and effective for disadvantaged communities, emphasizing the importance of doulas from the same communities they serve.

### Project Methodology

I conducted direct interviews with 12 insurance liaisons, doulas, and nonprofit leaders, and created partnerships that led to collecting over 300 responses from doulas through an extensive survey. The focus was on Oregon and Minnesota, states at the forefront of legislative actions regarding doula services.

### Key Findings

#### Barriers to Training and Application
The research highlighted significant barriers faced by doulas, particularly those of color and from low-income backgrounds. Key obstacles included high training fees, time constraints, and distance to training centers. The state response to applications was inconsistent, leading to additional hurdles. Notably, white and wealthier applicants faced fewer obstacles.

#### Legislation Effectiveness and Recommendations
The effectiveness of state legislation in reaching disadvantaged clients varied significantly. My findings suggest that waiving application fees, creating partnerships with community-based training centers to reduce training fees, and recognizing informal experience as valid for training can improve accessibility. Consistent communication and increasing reimbursement rates were also identified as crucial factors.

#### The Impact of Shared Backgrounds
The survey confirmed that most doulas believe a shared background with their client enhances their effectiveness. This underscores the need for legislative changes that support disadvantaged doulas, ensuring they are well-represented in the profession.

### Conclusion

My research points to the urgent need for reforms in doula programs to better serve disadvantaged communities. By addressing the barriers faced by doulas, particularly those from the communities they serve, we can make significant strides in reducing maternal mortality rates and improving outcomes for all mothers.
