The tech industry, once perceived as a haven of job security and innovation, faced a reality check with mass layoffs post-pandemic. While tech unemployment remains low at [2%](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/2024-tech-hiring-and-it-salary-trends-how-to-evolve-in-a-tech-talent-market-in-flux-301994147.html#:~:text=Read%20the%202024%20Tech%20Salary,well%20below%20the%20national%20average.), the wave of layoffs since 2022, affecting over 435,000 employees ([Layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi)), has altered perceptions significantly.

### A Rise in Job Hopping

The pandemic brought an unprecedented boom in the tech sector, leading to mass hiring. However, as the situation normalized, companies began to cut costs, resulting in widespread layoffs. This stark economic reality contradicted the previously held belief of perpetual growth and stability in tech. A LinkedIn study in 2021 highlighted the rise in job-hopping, particularly among younger workers, suggesting a shift in career dynamics post-pandemic ([LinkedIn Workforce Report, 2021](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/linkedin-workforce-report)).

### Recalibrating the Work Life Balance

There is also no doubt that the pandemic gave many of us an abundence of time to think and ponder what our priorities were. Before, many had seemingly accepted that work was a priority and it got in the way of life. But during the pandemic it was clear that work could be integrated into life well and our expectations adjusted for 2 years. The expectations haven't changed after the pandemic.  Pew Research Center's 2022 survey indicated that American workers, especially in tech, are increasingly seeking better work-life balance and job satisfaction, reshaping employer expectations ([Pew Research Center, 2022](https://www.pewresearch.org)). Even as bosses push for in person visits, hybrid is more of a norm that fully in person and once long term leases run out, it's likely that more companies will embrace more remote teams. 

### Community Responses and the Future of Tech Employment

The tech community's response to layoffs, as observed in platforms like Reddit, reveals a mix of disenchantment and a push for more ethical practices in the industry. In a 2023 Reddit thread ([Reddit, CS Career Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/120zatq/devs_both_survivors_and_the_impacted_how_have_the/)), tech workers shared experiences of disillusionment, but also stories of resilience and adaptation. The original poster describes that he has a negative perception impacting his work that wasn't there before. The comments urge the poster to realize that this is simply a cycle. to look towards Stoicism, and to finally use that rainy day fund. There wasn't denial, just pessimism. 

Looking forward, the tech industry may need to balance economic realities with a more humane approach to employment. The perception of tech as a stable and progressive field has been challenged, but it also opens doors for a more sustainable and employee-centric future in the industry.
