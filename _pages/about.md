        <p>Welcome to my website! I'm Gurman, and I'm passionate about finance, macro markets, and tech + society. Exploring the intersections of financial literacy, policy, and data-driven decision-making. Previously worked in governments, open source software groups, responsible tech nonprofits, and academia. </p>

        <p>I'm working on updating this website and it will serve as a platform where I share my insights, research findings, and thoughts on how data science intersects with and impacts political science. Feel free to explore my site and connect with me for any collaborative opportunities or discussions.</p>
