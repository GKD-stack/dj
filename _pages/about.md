        <p>Welcome to my website! I'm Gurman Dhaliwal, a passionate Data Scientist and Political Science researcher. Currently a student at <a href="https://datascience.ucsd.edu">Halicioglu Data Science Institute</a> at the <a href="https://ucsd.ucsd.edu">University of California, San Diego</a>, I am deeply involved in leveraging data science to influence the social science sphere and interested in understanding how tech is reshaping public policy.</p>

        <p> I've furthered my skills data science, policy development, and research by working for organizations in government, nonprofit, and academia. </p>

        <p>I've interned for <a href="https://www.sandiego.gov">City of San Diego</a>, <a href="https://www.census.gov">Census Bureau</a>, <a href="https://www.datasciencealliance.org">Data Science Alliance</a>, <a href="https://www.datasciencealliance.org">Acumen</a>, and I was a <a href="https://www.codingitforward.com">Coding it Forward</a> fellow last summer. 
        My professional journey is complemented by my leadership in campus undergraduate business organizations, student government and appointments to committees, such as the Chancellorâ€™s Committee on the Status of Women where I represented the interest of thousands of students. Outside of school, I'm helping build <a href="https://www.paragonfellowship.org/">Paragon</a> and I volunteer at <a href="https://www.investingirls.org/who-we-are/">Invest in Girls.</a></p>

        <p>On this platform, I share my insights, research findings, and thoughts on how data science intersects with and impacts political science. Feel free to explore my site and connect with me for any collaborative opportunities or discussions.</p>
