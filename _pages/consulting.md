# Data Science & Analytics Consulting

## Making Sense of Numbers That Matter
We help investment firms, financial advisors, and growing businesses turn messy data into clear decisions. With hands-on experience analyzing $3 trillion+ in assets at Capital Group, we bring institutional-grade analytics to organizations that need reliable insights but can't justify a full-time data scientist.

## Are You?
- 🎓 A Professor with research data that needs serious analysis but your grad students are swamped?
- 🏛️ A Policy Nonprofit sitting on survey data or government datasets that could inform your advocacy work?
- 🔍 A Researcher with messy datasets that need cleaning before you can publish anything meaningful?
- 📈 A Small Business Owner who knows your data has answers but can't figure out the right questions to ask?
- 🏢 A Growing Company that needs automated reporting but doesn't have the budget for a full analytics team?
- 💼 A Family Office looking for institutional-quality analysis without institutional overhead?

If any of these sound familiar, we can help.

### What We Actually Do
Investment & Portfolio Analysis	Automation That Actually Works	Making Data Make Sense
- Clean up performance data and spot what's working
- Turn manual Excel processes into Python workflows
- Automate processes that take too much time
- Create dashboards that update automatically
- Work with large datasets (20M+ data points)
- Build ML models for forecasting and classification
- Document everything so you're never stuck
- Bridge the gap between data and decision makers

### Why This Works
We've spent years in the trenches at Capital Group, working directly with investment directors on portfolio decisions worth millions. We've also built systems for the U.S. Census Bureau and Harvard researchers - so we know how to make complex analytics actually useful for busy professionals.

The bottom line: You get institutional-quality analysis without institutional overhead. We speak both code and finance, which means less time explaining and more time solving your actual problems.
