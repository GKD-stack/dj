Adriana continued to send text message via Telegram and eventually convinced the victim to send $2,000 via Zelle. Next, Adriana instructed the victim how to register and open an account on www.coinproxyus.com. Adriana uploaded a screenshot of the $2,000 that was supposedly deposited there and showed the victim their profits were increasing on the platform. Adriana encouraged the victim to cash out $100, the daily limit, which really showed up in his bank account. Adriana said that proved the account was fluid, that the platform worked, and that the victim would be able to get their money back. Adriana told the victim his account was only at the \u201cBasic\u201d level, and that if the victim upgraded to the \u201cBronze\u201d level they would have access to unlimited withdrawals, just like their friend had done. Still unaware of the hack, the victim contacted their friend on Instagram who confirmed the process and stated that the victim would be so happy with all that money and not worry about anything.

But when the victim tried to do so, they received an email from the platform saying they needed to file a trading certificate and provide personal information.

","Primary Subject":"Dapps-eth.io"},{"Type":"Pig Butchering Scam","Complaint Narrative":"A California victim was introduced by an acquaintance to a Defi Trading platform. The victim purchased Tether USDT crypto currency from Crypto.com, then connected his offline wallet to the exchange and began trading USDT\/Bitcoin futures contracts. The victim believed he was trading very successfully, so he transferred more money into the platform and believed his acquaintance was also crediting money into his account as well. The victim made a small withdrawal early in the process to \"test\" the process and his withdrawal went through. But after more \"successful\" trades, the victim attempted to make a larger withdrawal. At that point, the exchange informed him it did not allow such a large withdrawal, citing \u201canti-money laundering\u201d protocol established by the \u201cInternational Banking Regulatory Bureau,\u201d which required him to trade at least 50% of their deposits in their trading account within 24 hours of attempting a withdrawal. So, the victim deposited more funds into his account, and was told his acquaintance had transferred money into his account as well, so he could withdraw the amount he wanted. The exchange called this process a \u201crecharge.\u201d Again, the victim believed had made more successful trades and now had enough money to make his planned withdraw as he met the minimum trade threshold. This time, the exchange denied the withdrawal request, again citing the \u201cInternational Banking Regulatory Bureau\u201d concern that his account was being used for money laundering, effectively freezing my account to withdrawals. The victim asked how he could prove he was not a money launderer and was told by the exchange he would need to deposit into his wallet the exact amount he had been trying to withdraw, which was $650,000. The victim contacted his trading partner\/acquaintance, and she stated her account had also been frozen and that he would need to comply with the exchanges\u2019 instructions. He asked customer service what to do and was told if he transferred the $650,000 and provided a screen shot of the balance, they would release the funds. The victim took out a loan and deposited about half of the $650,000 in two installments into what he believed was a safe account for such purposes. But as soon as the second deposit went in, without his consent or knowledge the exchange moved the money into his trading account. He protested but was told this was to secure his funds while he finished the verification process. And that the only way to access his money would be to deposit the remaining funds to get to $650,000, although they said they would allow him to trade in the account \u2013 just not make withdrawals. His money is now trapped, and he is concerned that there might be problems with the exchange. He is also suspicious about his acquaintance, who told him she followed the exchange\u2019s instructions, borrowed money, and was finally able to withdraw her money and thus encouraged him to borrow more money as well.
